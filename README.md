# xQc Titles
Django website which tracks [**xQc**](https://www.twitch.tv/xqc)'s titles in real-time using [Twitch API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/) and does some stats.

## Features
- Database of unique titles (with their respective date and category)
  - Change timezone
  - Search anything and sort by date
  - Download in different formats
- Statistics of the titles
- AI Title Generator *(character-based RNN)*
  
[**Bootstrap Table**](https://bootstrap-table.com/) was a huge help and is the core component of the UI.
